            New features:
                Give fields a last used memory (save to file on choosing; load on start?)
                Add mode button for chronological ordering
                Add output window
                Add humanize layer

            Verify token count correctness (llama3.1,3.2)
            Add more sounds
            Stop docx corruption: Maybe save to a new folder instead?
            Allow asking before overwritting documents
            Climb flavor text??
            Multiple resumes at once?
            Make program more robust:
                Give it the ability to arrange unarranged cv Formats
                Make it detect unarranged cv formats
            Add loading icon
            Give program ability to take in user input to modify tailored resumes for easier consistency check iterating

[DONE]
    Organize resume printout (maybe stop using dicts for final output).
    Make it able to be executed several times despite errors in finding files
    Prompt engineer:
        Verbose is not included in model answers.
        Add explicit formatting
        Make summaries small (add word limit).
        
        Put numerical limit on vignettes and list items.
            Lists:Max 3 
            Skills:Max 6
    Fixed repeating titles
    Mention languages known in summary
    Add refresh button to search for more files
    Make a second cv, with long summaries 10 skills per sub section and 5 examples per section
    Figure out how to make deepseek not output all its thoughts
    Make format checking functions.
    Create Filter function to increase consistency
    Bugs "Fixed":
        Name, Title, Summary and Languages are incorrectly labeled as empty
        Missing sections on output:Title, Awards and Scholarships, Volunteering and Leadership
    Show Output CV Button

    Make use of word counters to check format of summary and descriptions
    Fixed Bugs:
        Show Output not ungreying
        Volunteering and Leadership empty [Fixed???]

    Save output to docx (need to format it as well).

    Make dropdown for templates
    Give docxs unique names
    Make format more concise and compact
    Make filter input?? And add it to refresh [Greyed out if not]
    Give it a last output memory? or make it save all the outputs
    Descriptions into lists implemented:

            Impact:
                [DONE]Update context
                [FIXED]Description gets duplicated when displayed as text

                [FIXED]First instance of format_check uses the wrong function
                [FIXED]On Doc Generation: An error occurred while generating the document: 'skills' is undefined

    Implemented better tokenizer math (ouput too)
    [DONE]Simplify tailor summary
    [DONE]Make output > MORE consistent:
    [DONE]Debug missing sections (likely model output error)
    [DONE]Verify that whenever the model chooses a duplicate experience, it does so without problems
    [DONE]Simplify consistency_checker_vs_cv
    [DONE]Simplify consistency_checker_vs_job_desc
        IDEA: Summarize resume and use that for analysis (additionally, also summarize job_desc)
        IDEA: Go section by section vs job_desc (maybe feeding in the old resume as contrast)
    [DONE]Simplify make_cover_letter_text
    [DONE]Introduce time analysis
    [DONE]Cut down on times we summarize resume: pass it as an arg to functions = store it
