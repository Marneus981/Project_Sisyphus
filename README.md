# Project: Sisyphus

## Foreword

### tldr: Job Seeking bad; I am developing Sisyphus to make "The Climb" a bit easier

If you have been a young adult (alive) for the last couple couple, you might have experienced the word of the modern-day job application process.

The future is now old man, long gone are the days of walking up to a manager, looking them dead in the eye and offering them a firm handshake, then getting that dream job. I mean that could **still** happen, but you would most likely end up getting escorted out of some corporate building hands shaking, eyes bloodshot.

Now, it is a numbers game, nothing less. You have AI systems vetoing your resume for not including the "self-starter" keyword, entry-level positions requiring 1-2 years of experience, online subscription-based services that "help" you with resume making (making as in hallucinating your job experience), and man let's not talk about ghosting and ghost jobs...

Out of personal experience I can confirm with utmost confidence that such an environment will crush you emotionally and spiritually and still have the gall to tell you that you are the problem. I have come to dislike all the corporate applications, all the senseless complexity. That's why I am developing Sisyphus: A local LLM-powered application and tool suite to help you make the process of applying to your next job just a bit less dystopian.

## What **IS** Sisyphus? And who was the real life inspiration behind this application's name?

### tldr: Sisyphus is a local resume tailoring tool suite; the guy? he was a character in Greek myth cursed by Zeus to push a boulder up a hill only for it to fall back down again, into eternity (see the parallels?)

### The Man
Not writing his myth (again): https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus
Do give it a read! (I'm literally him omg)

### The application
Sisyphus is currently an ***in-development*** application and tool suite for the common man (a.k.a. people that apply to jobs). This means that new features are constantly being added and certain functions are temporarily unavailable.

***IMPORTANT: Sisyphus is currently NOT ready for public use. The code has not been packaged to run locally on machines other than the ones I am currently testing it on.***

#### What Sisyphus aims to offer: 

1.- A free local LLM-powered application to help you generate tailored application packages (Cover Letter + Resume) given a Job Description and sufficient data about your experiences.
2.- Flexibility to tailor your job application resources according to your own desires. This means that in order to make the most use out of this toolset you are encouraged to ask questions and read the documentation (to be written teehee).

#### Things Sisyphus is not:

1.- A baseline for your paid application (it's meant to help students and job seekers have you no heart?)
2.- Paid
3.- Complete:
    3.1.- Literally not ready to run on any other machines (yet)
    3.2.- It has no documentation 
    3.3.- I will implement better UI and more user control
