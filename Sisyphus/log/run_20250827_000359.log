3. Familiarity with security best practices and experience with authentication, authorization, and encryption technologies.

Note that the requirements may vary based on the specific job opening and company needs.
Rewrite the project to best match the job description, following these guidelines:
- Do not include any information not present in the original experience.
- Keep all original subsections: Project Title, Type, Duration, Description, and Skills.
- Keep subsection names unchanged ("Project Title", "Type", "Duration", "Description", "Skills")
- In the Description subsection, rewrite to highlight achievements and relevant skills for the job, using up to 2 sentences (max 20 words each), as a single block of text.
- In the Skills subsection, include up to 6 relevant skills (Programming Languages, Technical Skills, Soft Skills). Every skill category should be present, even if empty.
- Do not use line breaks inside any subsection. Do not use the ":" character in the Description.
- Skills must be comma-separated and follow the format below.
- If there are no skills in a given category, use " ", then follow up as the format below indicates. 
    - For example: Programming Languages: ; Technical Skills: ; Soft Skills: Communication, Teamwork
- Include the prefix [1] at the start of each line (as seen in the format below).
Return only the revised section in the following format:
[1]Project Title: Project Title 1
[1]URL: https://example.com/project1
[1]Type: Type of Project 1
[1]Duration: Start Year 1/Start Month 1 - End Year 1/End Month 1
