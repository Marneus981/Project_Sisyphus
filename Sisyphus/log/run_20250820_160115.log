The following are some notable examples:\n\n* "Backend Engineer" from the tailored section corresponds to "Senior Software Engineer" in the raw section.\n* "designing and developing large-scale, 24/7 global infrastructure systems" from the tailored section is reflected in the raw section\'s mention of "architecting, developing, and deploying scalable backend systems."\n* "high-availability and performance-critical components" from the tailored section is hinted at in the raw section\'s description of delivering "innovative solutions across multiple industries."\n* "multiple programming languages, including Java, Python, and Ruby" from the tailored section corresponds to Jane\'s technical expertise listed in the raw section.\n\nUpon examining the two sections for contradictions, I found none between them. However, within the tailored section itself, there is a potential contradiction:\n\nThe tailored section claims proficiency in "data structures, algorithms, and software design patterns," but this information is not explicitly mentioned in the raw section. While it\'s possible that Jane\'s skills in these areas are implied or hinted at elsewhere in her resume, it would be more accurate to state that this information is not present in the original raw

This could potentially create a contradiction if an employer or reader were to assume that both awards were received on the same date (2015/06) due to their presentation as separate items.\n\nIn conclusion, while the tailored section does not contain any made-up information and presents all relevant data from the raw section, it may inadvertently create confusion by presenting two distinct awards together under a single heading.', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [128006, 9125, 128007, 271, 9125, 16, 3996, 128009, 128006, 882, 128007, 1432, 262, 16644, 279, 2768, 7257, 13365, 607, 3093, 16063, 3857, 512, 262, 510, 15, 60, 32, 4102, 323, 25542, 18143, 512, 58, 16, 60, 90640, 4076, 25, 25028, 753, 1796, 198, 58, 16, 60, 29316, 7623, 21021, 25, 53524, 3907, 198, 58, 16, 60, 43106, 2696, 25, 220, 679, 20, 14, 2705, 198, 58, 16, 60, 90640, 4076, 25, 17829, 38710, 58984, 198, 58, 16, 60, 29316, 7623, 21021, 25, 18880, 17829, 198, 58, 16, 60, 43106, 2696, 25, 220, 679, 22, 14, 2545, 198, 262, 1628, 279, 2768, 41891, 16063, 3857, 512, 262, 510, 15, 60, 32, 4102, 323, 25542, 18143, 512, 58, 16, 60, 90640, 4076, 25, 17829, 38710, 58984, 198, 58, 16, 60, 29316, 7623, 21021, 25, 18880, 17829, 198, 58, 16, 60, 43106, 2696, 25, 220, 679, 22, 14, 2545, 198, 58, 16, 60, 90640, 4076, 25, 25028, 753, 1796, 198, 58, 16, 60, 29316, 7623, 21021, 25, 53524, 3907, 198, 58, 16, 60, 43106, 2696, 25, 220, 679, 20, 14, 2705, 198, 262, 24702, 279, 1403, 16063, 14491, 323, 512, 262, 482, 34663, 430, 279, 41891, 3857, 1587, 539, 6782, 904, 1903, 5352, 2038, 627, 262, 482, 26504, 430, 682, 2038, 304, 279, 41891, 3857, 374, 3118, 304, 279, 7257, 3857, 11, 1524, 422, 63330, 81, 1503, 627, 262, 482, 65647, 904, 81523, 1990, 279, 1403, 14491, 627, 262, 482, 65647, 904, 81523, 2949, 279, 41891, 3857, 320, 4291, 5196, 4390, 262, 9442, 701, 6492, 439, 264, 3254, 19815, 925, 315, 1495, 11, 26549, 2768, 279, 3645, 3770, 512, 262, 510, 15, 60, 18825, 512, 257, 128009, 128006, 78191, 128007, 271, 58, 15, 60, 18825, 1473, 791, 41891, 16063, 3857, 1587, 539, 6782, 904, 1903, 5352, 2038, 13, 2052, 2038, 10666, 304, 279, 41891, 3857, 374, 3118, 304, 279, 7257, 3857, 11, 1524, 422, 63330, 81, 1503, 382, 791, 1193, 6811, 1990, 279, 1403, 14491, 374, 279, 2015, 315, 15864, 25, 279, 25028, 596, 1796, 10292, 8111, 1176, 304, 279, 7257, 3857, 323, 2132, 304, 279, 41891, 3857, 13, 1115, 13533, 430, 1070, 527, 912, 81523, 2949, 279, 41891, 3857, 320, 4291, 5196, 3677, 11458, 11, 5304, 12401, 26767, 11, 433, 649, 387, 13468, 430, 279, 7257, 3857, 18911, 1403, 8821, 23146, 449, 2204, 13003, 320, 80966, 596, 1796, 304, 220, 679, 20, 14, 2705, 323, 17829, 38710, 58984, 304, 220, 679, 22, 14, 2545, 705, 20444, 279, 41891, 3857, 11725, 2225, 23146, 3871, 1234, 279, 1890, 330, 32, 4102, 323, 25542, 18143, 1, 14836, 13, 1115, 1436, 13893, 1893, 264, 50859, 422, 459, 19683, 477, 6742, 1051, 311, 9855, 430, 2225, 23146, 1051, 4036, 389, 279, 1890, 2457, 320, 679, 20, 14, 2705, 8, 4245, 311, 872, 15864, 439, 8821, 3673, 382, 644, 17102, 11, 1418, 279, 41891, 3857, 1587, 539, 6782, 904, 1903, 5352, 2038, 323, 18911, 682, 9959, 828, 505, 279, 7257, 3857, 11, 433, 1253, 70185, 1893, 22047, 555, 32644, 1403, 12742, 23146, 3871, 1234, 264, 3254, 14836, 13], 'total_duration': 33409006800, 'load_duration': 120507800, 'prompt_eval_count': 279, 'prompt_eval_duration': 1381477000, 'eval_count': 223, 'eval_duration': 31904321900}

Upon comparison, I confirm that there is no made-up information in the tailored section.\n\nAll the job titles, companies, locations, and durations listed in the tailored section are present in the raw section. The descriptions in the tailored section also seem to be paraphrased versions of the original descriptions in the raw section.\n\nHowever, upon closer examination, I notice some contradictions between the two sections:\n\n* In the raw section, the job title "Software Engineer" at WebApps Inc. has a description that mentions implementing microservices and contributing to Docker and Kubernetes adoption. The tailored section does not include these details.\n* In the raw section, the job title "Systems Administrator Intern" at Capital Tech has a description that mentions developing monitoring dashboards and automated alert systems. The tailored section only includes the information about improving server uptime by 15% and contributing to security audits.\n\nThere are no contradictions within the tailored section itself, as it appears to be a concise summary of the relevant experience from the raw section.\n\nOverall, while the tailored resume section is condensed and focused on the most important information, there may be some minor discrepancies between it and the original raw section.', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [128006, 9125, 128007, 271, 9125, 16, 3996, 128009, 128006, 882, 128007, 1432, 262,

        Now, given this information, synthesize a report which extracts the following data from the list of analyses:
        - If the new resume is consistent with the original resume, meaning that all information in the new resume is present in the original resume, even if paraphrased.
        - If the new resume is consistent with itself, meaning that there should be no contradictions or inconsistencies in the information provided.
        The consistency check should be returned strictly in the following format:

        [0]Consistency Checker VS Original Resume:
        [1]Inconsistencies With Original Resume: [Yes/No]; [List of inconsistencies found, if any; return 'None' if no inconsistencies; must be a continuous block of text, composed of sentences separated by ".", not line breaks]
        [1]Inconsistencies With Self: [Yes/No]; [List of inconsistencies found, if any; return 'None' if no inconsistencies; must be a continuous block of text, composed of sentences separated by ".", not line breaks]
        [1]Suggestions for Improvement: [List of suggestions for improvement, if any; return 'None' if no suggestions; must be a continuous block of text, composed of sentences separated by ".", not line breaks]

        Be mindful not to include any line breaks in  the content of any of the sections/subsections.
        In the above format, always include the numbers "[0]", "[1]", etc.
        Be as objective as possible, and if you must make assumptions, make very conservative assumptions; this also means that you should create nor imagine any data that is not present in the original resume data.

Upon comparing the two, I confirm that the tailored section does not contain any made-up information.\n\nAll the information in the tailored section is present in the raw section, although it may have been paraphrased or rearranged for better clarity and concision. The following are some examples of how the information was adapted:\n\n* "Experienced engineer with a proven track record" corresponds to "Senior Software Engineer with more than 15 years of experience" in the raw section.\n* "Building and maintaining large-scale infrastructure systems for high-growth organizations" is an excerpt from the raw section, which describes Jane\'s projects as "cloud migration projects that resulted in a 30% reduction in operational costs and a 95% stakeholder satisfaction rate".\n* "Designing and developing distributed infrastructure systems, ensuring high availability and scalability" corresponds to Jane\'s technical expertise in designing and implementing microservices architectures.\n* "Leading cross-functional teams to deliver complex projects in fast-paced global environments" is an excerpt from the raw section, which describes Jane\'s leadership experience in managing and mentoring teams of up to 20 engineers.\n\nHowever, there are a few contradictions between the two sections:\n\n* The raw section mentions Jane\'s technical expertise in multiple programming languages, whereas the tailored section does not explicitly mention any specific programming languages.\n* The raw section highlights Jane\'s passion for mentoring, empowering others, and bridging the digital divide, whereas these aspects are not mentioned in the tailored section.\n\nWithin the tailored section itself, there is no apparent contradiction. However, it could be argued that the section is too concise and does not provide sufficient detail to fully convey Jane\'s extensive experience and achievements.\n\nIn conclusion, while the tailored resume section appears to be a condensed version of the raw untailored resume section, it does not contain any made-up information.

All the information present in the tailored section is indeed found in the raw section, albeit possibly paraphrased.\n\nHowever, there are some minor differences between the two sections. The major difference lies in the ordering of the awards and scholarships.

The main difference between them is the level of detail and presentation style.\n\nUpon comparing the two sections, I can confirm that all information in the tailored section is present in the raw section, even if paraphrased. For instance, the role of Hackathon Organizer at TechFest is described similarly in both sections, with a focus on event planning and logistics.\n\nHowever, there are some contradictions between the two sections. In the raw section, it mentions that as Hackathon Organizer, the candidate "increased event attendance by 50% and built strong relationships with sponsors and partners." In contrast, the tailored section only mentions building "scalable event infrastructure" and ensuring "high reliability and uptime with efficient logistics and sponsorship management." While the tailored section does not explicitly state increased event attendance, it implies that the candidate\'s efforts led to a successful event.\n\nFurthermore, there are no contradictions within the tailored section itself. The description of the Hackathon Organizer role is consistent and focused on the candidate\'s technical skills and organizational abilities.\n\nIn conclusion, while both resume sections describe

Upon comparing the two sections, I can confirm that the tailored section does not contain any made-up information.\n\nAll information in the tailored section is present in the raw section, with some minor paraphrasing. For example, "Designed large-scale system for scheduling conflicts reduction by 40%" is a summary of the raw description, which mentions reducing scheduling conflicts by 40% and utilizing cloud integration and API to improve staff satisfaction.\n\nThere are no contradictions between the two sections. However, within the tailored section, I did notice some potential inconsistencies:\n\n* The "Employee Scheduling App" project description in the tailored section does not mention anything about calendar APIs or notifications, which are mentioned in the raw section.\n* The "E-Commerce Recommendation Engine" project description in the tailored section only mentions improving user retention and sales conversion, whereas the raw section also mentions optimizing model performance and providing training and support for marketing teams.\n\nOverall, while there may be some minor discrepancies within the tailored section, it primarily appears to be a condensed version of the raw project descriptions.', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'context': [128006, 9125, 128007, 271, 9125, 16,

[0] Analysis: The tailored resume section appears to be truthful and does not contain any made-up information. It presents a subset of the skills and abilities mentioned in the raw section, without adding or changing any details.
        Now, given this information, synthesize a report which extracts the following data from the list of analyses:
        - If the new resume is consistent with the original resume, meaning that all information in the new resume is present in the original resume, even if paraphrased.
        - If the new resume is consistent with itself, meaning that there should be no contradictions or inconsistencies in the information provided.
        The consistency check should be returned strictly in the following format:

        [0]Consistency Checker VS Original Resume:
        [1]Inconsistencies With Original Resume: [Yes/No]; [List of inconsistencies found, if any; return 'None' if no inconsistencies; must be a continuous block of text, composed of sentences separated by ".", not line breaks]
        [1]Inconsistencies With Self: [Yes/No]; [List of inconsistencies found, if any; return 'None' if no inconsistencies; must be a continuous block of text, composed of sentences separated by ".", not line breaks]
        [1]Suggestions for Improvement: [List of suggestions for improvement, if any; return 'None' if no suggestions; must be a continuous block of text, composed of sentences separated by ".", not line breaks]

        Be mindful not to include any line breaks in  the content of any of the sections/subsections.
        In the above format, always include the numbers "[0]", "[1]", etc.
        Be as objective as possible, and if you must make assumptions, make very conservative assumptions; this also means that you should create nor imagine any data that is not present in the original resume data.

        - If the new resume is consistent with the original resume, meaning that all information in the new resume is present in the original resume, even if paraphrased.
        - If the new resume is consistent with itself, meaning that there should be no contradictions or inconsistencies in the information provided.
        The consistency check should be returned strictly in the following format:

        [0]Consistency Checker VS Original Resume:
        [1]Inconsistencies With Original Resume: [Yes/No]; [List of inconsistencies found, if any; return 'None' if no inconsistencies; must be a continuous block of text, composed of sentences separated by ".", not line breaks]

        [1]Suggestions for Improvement: [List of suggestions for improvement, if any; return 'None' if no suggestions; must be a continuous block of text, composed of sentences separated by ".", not line breaks]

        Be mindful not to include any line breaks in  the content of any of the sections/subsections.
        In the above format, always include the numbers "[0]", "[1]", etc.
        Be as objective as possible, and if you must make assumptions, make very conservative assumptions; this also means that you should create nor imagine any data that is not present in the original resume data.
