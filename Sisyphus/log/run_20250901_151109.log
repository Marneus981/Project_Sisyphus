 [R]Committee Student Member (Scholarship Committee, University of Toronto)
[R]Engineering Science Program Ambassador (ENGSOC)

Notes: While both roles demonstrate relevant soft skills such as communication, teamwork, and adaptability, they do not directly involve programming in Python or JavaScript. However, the experience gained in problem-solving, collaboration, and decision-making could be valuable for the software engineering role at Sentry. Furthermore, the technical skills of documentation, Microsoft Suite usage, and analytical problem-solving may also be applicable.

Additionally, I would suggest highlighting any relevant coursework or projects that demonstrate proficiency in Python, JavaScript, or both, as well as experience with version control and unit testing. This information might not be available within the provided resume section but could potentially enhance the candidate's application for the Software Engineer position at Sentry.

[0]Title: New Grad Software Engineer
[0]Summary: As a recent Computer Science graduate from the University of Toronto (2023), I bring a solid foundation in programming languages such as Python and JavaScript, along with a strong understanding of algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented design principles. With experience from my internship at DEF Consulting and Junior Software Developer role at ABC Tech, I've honed my skills in the full software development lifecycle - design, development, testing, and operating in production. Effective communication, teamwork, openness to feedback, and mentorship are areas I excel in. Excited about contributing to Sentry's product development as a Software Engineer, New Graduate, and eager to engage daily with open-source projects.

    [S]awards_and_scholarships Section Summary: The candidate has demonstrated a strong commitment to academic excellence and global engagement. In 2018, they were awarded the University of Toronto Engineering Scholarship, showcasing their exceptional academic achievement in the field of engineering. More recently, in 2023, they participated in the United Nations Datathon, demonstrating their ability to work on high-level, global projects and contribute to data-driven solutions for societal issues.
[S]volunteering_and_leadership Section Summary: The candidate has a history of active involvement in community service and leadership roles. However, specific details regarding these activities are not provided in the given sections. It can be inferred that they possess skills such as teamwork, initiative, and a commitment to making a positive impact in their community, as evidenced by their volunteer work and leadership positions.
    [S]work_experience Section Summary: Marneus has a history of software development in various projects, demonstrating proficiency in Python, C++, and object-oriented design principles. He has worked on open-source personal projects as well as university projects. His most recent project involves developing AI-integrated game tools for the Sentry product, focusing on automated debugging, scripting, and unit testing (2023/06 - Present). In his previous university project, he created a hybrid CRNN model in Python for optical music recognition, processing over 100,000 samples from the PrIMuS dataset (2021/01 - 2021/06). Earlier, he developed and optimized a GIS system using C++, EZGL Library, and OpenStreetMap API for improved efficiency and reduced memory usage. He also co-designed the UI/UX to meet stakeholder needs (2019/09 - 2020/06).
[S]projects Section Summary: Marneus' projects showcase his diverse skills in software development, artificial intelligence, and design. His open-source personal project, TTRPGTools, focuses on game development with AI integration (2023/06 - Present). In a university project, he developed a hybrid CRNN model for optical music recognition, which processed a large dataset of sheet music samples (2021/01 - 2021/06). He also created MAPPA, a GIS system optimized for efficiency and reduced memory usage, utilizing C++, EZGL Library, and OpenStreetMap API. Additionally, he co-designed the UI/UX tailored to stakeholder needs (2019/09 - 2020/06).
