 [R]Committee Student Member (University of Toronto)
[R]Engineering Science Program Ambassador (ENGSOC)

Notes: The Committee Student Member role demonstrates collaboration, decision-making, and communication skills which align with the job description. As an Engineering Science Program Ambassador, the candidate has experience in outreach, customer service, and communication – all relevant to the Software Engineer position. However, while these roles showcase important soft skills, they do not directly involve programming in Python or JavaScript, the specific technical requirements for the Software Engineer role. To address this gap, it would be beneficial for the candidate to showcase some independent project work or personal coding activities that demonstrate proficiency in these languages.
