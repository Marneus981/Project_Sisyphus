[R]Engineering Science Program Ambassador (ENGSOC)

Notes: Both roles demonstrate leadership skills, good communication, and collaboration. However, neither directly involves software development or a high-growth startup environment as specified in the job description. Therefore, while relevant to some extent, they may not be the most compelling choices for this particular job application. It's recommended to emphasize these experiences in other contexts where leadership and communication are valued but software engineering skills are less critical. For the Sentry Software Engineer, New Grad position, it would be beneficial to focus on experiences or projects that showcase proficiency in programming languages such as Python or JavaScript, understanding of algorithms, data structures, and object-oriented design principles, as well as experience with version control and unit testing.
