Based on the job description and the provided "Volunteering and Leadership" resume section, I recommend the following four experiences as the most relevant:

[R]Coding Bootcamp Mentor
[R]Open Source Contributor
[R]Event Coordinator
[R]Workshop Presenter

These experiences demonstrate skills in programming languages (Python), cloud-based infrastructure (cloud integration), containerization (Docker), distributed systems, and problem-solving, which are all required or desired skills for the Backend Engineer role at DoorDash. Additionally, these experiences show strong communication, leadership, and teamwork skills, which are also important for success in this role.

Please note that I have not included any of the other experiences that do not match the job description as closely, such as Hackathon Organizer, STEM Volunteer, Community Tech Educator, Youth Robotics Coach, or Science Fair Judge.

[0]Summary: As a highly motivated Senior Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience, I bring strong academic foundations and notable certifications to the table. With expertise in building scalable APIs, optimizing database queries, and leading refactoring efforts, I can effectively design, develop, test, and maintain scalable and reliable backend systems. Notable skills include proficiency in cloud-based infrastructure (AWS), containerization (Docker), data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and strong problem-solving skills for troubleshooting complex technical issues. Additionally, I have experience working with cross-functional teams and prioritizing tasks effectively in a fast-paced environment. I am excited to bring my skills and experiences to a Backend Engineer role at DoorDash, where I can utilize my knowledge of distributed systems, caching, and queuing mechanisms to support the company's 3-sided marketplace.

[0]Summary: As a highly motivated Senior Software Engineer with 3+ years of experience, I bring strong academic foundations and notable certifications to the table. With expertise in building scalable APIs, optimizing database queries, and leading refactoring efforts, I can effectively design, develop, test, and maintain scalable and reliable backend systems. Notable skills include proficiency in cloud-based infrastructure (AWS), containerization (Docker), data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, and strong problem-solving skills for troubleshooting complex technical issues. Additionally, I have experience working with cross-functional teams and prioritizing tasks effectively in a fast-paced environment. I am excited to bring my skills and experiences to a Backend Engineer role at DoorDash, where I can utilize my knowledge of distributed systems, caching, and queuing mechanisms to support the company's 3-sided marketplace.
