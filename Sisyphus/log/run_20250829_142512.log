    Tailor a Summary section for a resume to best match the job description;
    Make sure to mention the most relevant skills and experiences from the CV that match the job description.
    Return only the revised section and strictly follow the format:

    [0]Summary: Brief summary of the candidate's qualifications, skills, and experiences relevant to the job description.
    
    Notes:
    - Write the tailored summary section as the candidate, not as an external observer.
    - Do not include any characters before [0]
    - The "Summary" section may have up to 150 words.

Rewrite the project to best match the job description, following these guidelines:
- Do not include any information not present in the original experience.
- Keep all original subsections: Project Title, Type, Duration, Description, and Skills.
- Keep subsection names unchanged ("Project Title", "Type", "Duration", "Description", "Skills")
- In the Description subsection, rewrite to highlight achievements and relevant skills for the job, using up to 2 sentences (max 20 words each), as a single block of text.
- In the Skills subsection, include up to 6 relevant skills (Programming Languages, Technical Skills, Soft Skills). Every skill category should be present, even if empty.
- Do not use line breaks inside any subsection. Do not use the ":" character in the Description.
- Skills must be comma-separated and follow the format below.
- If there are no skills in a given category, use " ", then follow up as the format below indicates. 
    - For example: Programming Languages: ; Technical Skills: ; Soft Skills: Communication, Teamwork
- Include the prefix [1] at the start of each line (as seen in the format below).
Return only the revised section in the following format:
[1]Project Title: Project Title 1
[1]URL: https://example.com/project1
[1]Type: Type of Project 1
[1]Duration: Start Year 1/Start Month 1 - End Year 1/End Month 1
[1]Description: Brief description for Project Title 1.

Upon reviewing both sections, I confirm that all information in the tailored section is present in the raw section, even if paraphrased.\n\nOne notable difference between the two sections is the omission of several projects from the raw section in the tailored section. Specifically, the following projects are missing from the tailored section: Horizontal Federated Learning Research, UNIX-based Operative System Development, MAPPA C++ Geographical Information System, Virtual Piano in Verilog/Assembly, TTRPG Tools, VKnob, Untitled RPG Game Project, and My Portfolio.\n\nThe omission of these projects does not constitute made-up information. However, it may lead to the impression that the candidate has fewer project experiences than they actually do.\n\nWithin the tailored section itself, there are no apparent contradictions. The two projects included (Magia Chef and Neural Signal Modelling) appear to be accurately represented in the tailored section.\n\nIn terms of overall accuracy, I conclude that the tailored resume

    - Confirm that the tailored section does not contain any made-up information.
    - Verify that all information in the tailored section is present in the raw section, even if paraphrased.
    - Identify any contradictions between the two sections.
    - Identify any contradictions within the tailored section (with itself).

Upon comparison, I confirmed that all information in the tailored section is present in the raw section, even if paraphrased.\n\nHowever, I did notice some differences between the two sections:\n\n* The raw section lists numerous programming languages, while the tailored section only mentions Python, C#, and JavaScript.\n* The raw section includes various technical skills such as 2D/3D Animation, AI, ARPG Games, and more. In contrast, the tailored section focuses on Full-Stack Development, Data Analysis, Scripting, and Software Development Cycle.\n* The raw section has a separate category for Soft Skills, which includes items like Adaptability, Conflict Resolution, and Research. The tailored section combines these skills under the categories of Communication, Good Written and Communication Skills, Problem Solving, and Self-Starter.\n\nUpon closer examination, I found no contradictions within the tailored section itself. However, there might be some subtle differences in emphasis or phrasing between the two sections that could lead to varying interpretations by potential employers.\n\nIn conclusion, while the tailored resume section appears to be a curated version of the raw section, it still maintains the essence of the original information and does not contain any made-up details.', 'done': True, 'done_reason':

        - If the new resume is consistent with the original resume, meaning that all information in the new resume is present in the original resume, even if paraphrased.
        - If the new resume is consistent with itself, meaning that there should be no contradictions or inconsistencies in the information provided.
        The consistency check should be returned strictly in the following format:

        [0]Consistency Checker VS Original Resume:
        [1]Inconsistencies With Original Resume: [Yes/No]; [List of inconsistencies found, if any; return 'None' if no inconsistencies; must be a continuous block of text, composed of sentences separated by ".", not line breaks]

        [1]Suggestions for Improvement: [List of suggestions for improvement, if any; return 'None' if no suggestions; must be a continuous block of text, composed of sentences separated by ".", not line breaks]

        Be mindful not to include any line breaks in  the content of any of the sections/subsections.
        In the above format, always include the numbers "[0]", "[1]", etc.
        Be as objective as possible, and if you must make assumptions, make very conservative assumptions; this also means that you should create nor imagine any data that is not present in the original resume data.
