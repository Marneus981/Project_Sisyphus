Rewrite the project to best match the job description, following these guidelines:
- Do not include any information not present in the original experience.
- Keep all original subsections: Project Title, Type, Duration, Description, and Skills.
- Keep subsection names unchanged ("Project Title", "Type", "Duration", "Description", "Skills")
- In the Description subsection, rewrite to highlight achievements and relevant skills for the job, using up to 2 sentences (max 20 words each), as a single block of text.
- In the Skills subsection, include up to 6 relevant skills (Programming Languages, Technical Skills, Soft Skills). Every skill category should be present, even if empty.
- Do not use line breaks inside any subsection. Do not use the ":" character in the Description.
- Skills must be comma-separated and follow the format below.
- If there are no skills in a given category, use " ", then follow up as the format below indicates. 
    - For example: Programming Languages: ; Technical Skills: ; Soft Skills: Communication, Teamwork
- Include the prefix [1] at the start of each line (as seen in the format below).
Return only the revised section in the following format:
[1]Project Title: Project Title 1
[1]URL: https://example.com/project1
[1]Type: Type of Project 1
[1]Duration: Start Year 1/Start Month 1 - End Year 1/End Month 1
[1]Description: Brief description for Project Title 1.
