Entry-Level Software Engineer,"Hi there! Just graduated with a computer science/engineering degree and looking for your next challenge? If you're looking to make a real-world impact fast while leveling up your skills in a high-growth startup, we might be the right place for you! Why join Jerry?
We’re Jerry, and we’re building the first AI-powered AllCar™ app to completely rethink what it means to own a car. Car insurance, maintenance, repairs, financing—we’re simplifying it all into one seamless mobile experience. Our users already save over $1,000/year with us, and we’ve grown revenue 60x in the last 5 years.
Now we’re scaling from 5M to 50M users, and we need sharp, curious engineers to help us get there.
Here’s what you’ll get:
Impact from Day One — you’ll be writing production code within your first few weeks.
Backed and booming — we’ve raised $240M+ and are cash-flow positive.
Modern tech stack — React, Node, Python, AWS, TypeScript, and more.
Mentorship + learning — work with top engineers from companies like Nvidia, TikTok, and Cepton.
Merit-based growth — no seniority theater here. You grow fast if you deliver and learn fast.
What you’ll be working on
You’ll join one of our engineering pods (core app, retention, automation) depending on your interests and skills. Every team ships regularly, works closely with product, and contributes to a mission that matters.
We don’t expect you to know everything on day one, but we do expect:
A love for learning
Comfort with ambiguity
Hustle and curiosity
Pride in building high-quality, user-first software
Our stack:
Frontend: React, React Native
Backend: NodeJS + TypeScript
Infra: AWS, Go, Python, Docker, CI/CD
Data: Redis, Postgres, DynamoDB, Clickhouse
AI/ML: Python pipelines, LLM integrations, internal models
You don’t need to know it all—but if some of that excites you, let’s talk.
What we’re looking for:
Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, Engineering, or a related field (or graduating soon)
Internship, co-op, or side project experience is a plus—but not required
Eagerness to learn, build, and grow
